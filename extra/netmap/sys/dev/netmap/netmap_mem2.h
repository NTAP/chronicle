 *
 * (New) memory allocator for netmap
 */

/*
 * This allocator creates three memory pools:
 *	nm_if_pool	for the struct netmap_if
 *	nm_ring_pool	for the struct netmap_ring
 *	nm_buf_pool	for the packet buffers.
 *
 * that contain netmap objects. Each pool is made of a number of clusters,
 * multiple of a page size, each containing an integer number of objects.
 * The clusters are contiguous in user space but not in the kernel.
 * Only nm_buf_pool needs to be dma-able,
 * but for convenience use the same type of allocator for all.
 *
 * Once mapped, the three pools are exported to userspace
 * as a contiguous block, starting from nm_if_pool. Each
 * cluster (and pool) is an integral number of pages.
 *   [ . . . ][ . . . . . .][ . . . . . . . . . .]
 *    nm_if     nm_ring            nm_buf
 *
 * The userspace areas contain offsets of the objects in userspace.
 * When (at init time) we write these offsets, we find out the index
 * of the object, and from there locate the offset from the beginning
 * of the region.
 *
 * The invididual allocators manage a pool of memory for objects of
 * the same size.
 * The pool is split into smaller clusters, whose size is a
 * multiple of the page size. The cluster size is chosen
 * to minimize the waste for a given max cluster size
 * (we do it by brute force, as we have relatively few objects
 * per cluster).
 *
 * Objects are aligned to the cache line (64 bytes) rounding up object
 * sizes when needed. A bitmap contains the state of each object.
 * Allocation scans the bitmap; this is done only on attach, so we are not
 * too worried about performance
 *
 * For each allocator we can define (thorugh sysctl) the size and
 * number of each object. Memory is allocated at the first use of a
 * netmap file descriptor, and can be freed when all such descriptors
 * have been released (including unmapping the memory).
 * If memory is scarce, the system tries to get as much as possible
 * and the sysctl values reflect the actual allocation.
 * Together with desired values, the sysctl export also absolute
 * min and maximum values that cannot be overridden.
 *
 * struct netmap_if:
 *	variable size, max 16 bytes per ring pair plus some fixed amount.
 *	1024 bytes should be large enough in practice.
 *
 *	In the worst case we have one netmap_if per ring in the system.
 *
 * struct netmap_ring
 *	variable size, 8 byte per slot plus some fixed amount.
 *	Rings can be large (e.g. 4k slots, or >32Kbytes).
 *	We default to 36 KB (9 pages), and a few hundred rings.
 *
 * struct netmap_buffer
 *	The more the better, both because fast interfaces tend to have
 *	many slots, and because we may want to use buffers to store
 *	packets in userspace avoiding copies.
 *	Must contain a full frame (eg 1518, or more for vlans, jumbo
 *	frames etc.) plus be nicely aligned, plus some NICs restrict
 *	the size to multiple of 1K or so. Default to 2K

 * netmap_adapter is freed (this is implemented by the NAF_MEM_OWNER flag in
 * netmap.c).  The 'refcount' field counts the number of active users of the
 * structure. The global allocator uses this information to prevent/allow
 * reconfiguration. The private allocators release all their memory when there
 * are no active users.  By 'active user' we mean an existing netmap_priv
 * structure holding a reference to the allocator.
